# ADM-HW4-G18

The group is composed by: Alessandra Anna Griesi, Hannes Engelhardt and Federica Spoto.

In this assignment we solved two different task: in the first one we perform a clustering analysis of house announcements, taking the data through web scraping; in the second one we define two hash functions to check the presence of duplicates in a list of passwords.

## Data Source
For the first task, we used the data of the [Immobiliare.it](https://www.immobiliare.it/) website, taking into account more than 10k announcements. 
For the second task, tha password are given as an input in the file [passwords2.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wTmOU-yqk4qdQYg42AquhzgpNGrRA96d/view).

## Description of the project
In this repository you will find:
1. `Homework_4.ipynb`: 
the Jupyter file contains all the work done in light of the achievement of the final results:

  - Implementation and comments of **Task 1**;
  
  - Implementation and comments of **Task 2**;
  
  - **Bonus step**: implement the K-means algorithm from scratch.
  
2. `function.py`:
the file contains all the functions created during the study and used in `Homework_4.ipynb`.
